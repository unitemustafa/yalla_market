# Section A — General Engineering Rules

## 1) Architecture & Separation of Concerns (YOU MUST FOLLOW)
- Follow the project's architecture layer boundaries strictly: presentation → domain → data
- Never bypass layers or mix responsibilities
- UI/presentation layer has ZERO business logic — only rendering, interaction, and state observation
- Business logic lives in the domain layer
- Data access (APIs, databases, storage) lives in the data layer
- Do not introduce new abstractions or patterns without justification

## 2) Shared Code (IMPORTANT)
- Any reusable logic, utility, constant, extension, or helper used in 2+ places goes in `core/`
- Check `core/` before creating new shared code — never duplicate across features

## 3) Error Handling
- Errors flow cleanly across layers — never skip layers
- Handle null, empty, loading, and error states explicitly — no silent failures
- Catch errors at the boundary (data layer), not deep inside business logic

## 4) Change Discipline
- Make the smallest change that solves the problem
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Don't refactor unrelated code unless explicitly requested
- Never break existing functionality, APIs, flows, or UX unless explicitly instructed
- Read relevant code before modifying it — state assumptions when unclear

## 5) Dependencies
- Don't add new packages without justification
- Any new package must be: latest stable, well-maintained, production-grade

## 6) Security
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Never log sensitive information
- Validate all external and API input
- Proactively flag security risks when spotted

## 7) Testing
- Write tests for domain and data layer logic
- Bug fixes must include a reproducing test
- Tests must be deterministic — no flaky or timing-dependent tests
- One behavior per test case

## 8) Workflow (Mandatory)
- Before creating any new feature → invoke the `/flutter-feature` skill first for scaffolding and architecture reference
- Before marking any task done → run the `/flutter-code-review` skill
- After task approved → use the `@git-expert` agent for branch, commit, and PR output

## 9) Agents — Proactively Suggest (YOU MUST FOLLOW)
You MUST proactively suggest the appropriate agent when the situation matches. Do not wait for the user to ask.

- `@debugger` — When a bug, crash, error, or unexpected behavior is encountered
- `@code-reviewer` — After `/flutter-code-review` passes, ALWAYS suggest running `@code-reviewer` for a deeper independent review before proceeding to PR
- `@test-writer` — When code is changed or added without corresponding tests, or when test coverage is missing
- `@git-expert` — When it's time to create a branch, commit, or PR. Also for merge conflicts, rebases, or any complex git situation

# Section B — Flutter / Dart Specific Rules

<!--
Follow official Dart style guide, Effective Dart, and flutter_lints defaults.
Rules below only cover things that OVERRIDE defaults or encode project decisions.
-->

## 1) State Management
- Use **Cubit/Bloc** for feature and application state — not Riverpod, Provider, or GetX
- Cubits depend ONLY on use cases — never directly on repositories or data sources
- `setState` is allowed ONLY for local UI state (e.g., toggles, form focus) — never for business logic
- Keep `setState` scoped to the smallest widget possible to avoid redundant rebuilds up the tree

## 2) No Code Generation
- **No Freezed. No build_runner.** Use Dart 3+ native features instead:
  - `sealed class` for state unions with exhaustive pattern matching
  - `switch` expressions and records for lightweight data

## 3) Domain Layer Purity
- Domain layer must have ZERO Flutter imports
- No `package:flutter/...` in any file under `domain/`

## 4) Feature Folder Structure
- `features/{feature_name}/data/`
- `features/{feature_name}/domain/`
- `features/{feature_name}/presentation/`

## 5) Error Handling Contract
- Data layer: catch exceptions and map to typed `Failure` classes
- Domain layer: return `ApiResult<T>` from use cases and repositories
- Presentation layer: map failures to user-friendly messages and UI states

## 6) Dependency Injection
- Use **`get_it`** as the service locator
- Register dependencies in a single `core/di/` setup file
- Cubits, use cases, and repositories are resolved via `get_it`, not instantiated manually

## 7) Build Method Discipline (IMPORTANT)
- Prefer `const` constructors wherever possible
- NEVER create `TextEditingController`, `AnimationController`, `FocusNode`, or other expensive objects inside `build()`
- Avoid heavy work inside `build()` methods
- Dispose controllers and focus nodes in `StatefulWidget.dispose()`
- Prefer small, composed widgets to minimize rebuild scope
- Use `BlocBuilder`/`BlocSelector` on the smallest widget that needs the state — never at the top of the tree
